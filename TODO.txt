- Add an option for other type of subtitle files, for example ".sub".

- Handle the case of more than one .srt files inside the directory.
   Probably, a struct for the .srts files found can be used associating
   a number to every file found. The user will be able to choose
   the file to alternate by passing the number as the input.
   An idea is to store those structs in a linked list.  

- Possible bug? --> What happens when the delay is negative and 
   its absolute value is larger than a timestamp (usually timestamps in the beginning of the film). 
   VLC does not complain when a timestamp is negative, but should I try to avoid it?
