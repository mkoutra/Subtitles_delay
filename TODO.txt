- Add an option for other type of subtitle files, for example ".sub".

- Possible bug? --> What happens when the delay is negative and 
   its absolute value is larger than a timestamp (usually timestamps in the beginning of the film). 
   VLC does not complain when a timestamp is negative, but should I try to avoid it?
